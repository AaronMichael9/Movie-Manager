# Movie-Manager
Movie Manager was designed to track my personal movie collection. All information is stored in a text file named movies.csv. All information can be entered through the program's UI.
Movie Manager tracks the following information:
*title
*series
*rating
*tags

Movie Manager allows filtering based on the following:
*partial title
*min/max rating
*series
*tags

Additionally, the selection screen allows for random selection of an arbitrary number of movies based on filter criteria. By default this selection is exponentially weighted by rating.
